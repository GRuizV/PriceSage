# PriceSage

**"Track. Analyze. Buy Smart."**

PriceSage is an end-to-end pricing intelligence system that tracks daily prices of Finasteride from local distributors. It includes:

- 📈 A headless web scraper to collect dynamic price data
- 📊 Historical price visualization and trend analysis
- 📬 Smart alerts when prices hit user-defined thresholds
- 🤖 (Upcoming) Predictive analysis of future price trends
- 📦 Dockerized deployment for local or cloud execution

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

To automate the process of tracking Finasteride prices for personal use, while using the project to learn and demonstrate:

- Data scraping with Selenium/Playwright
- Data wrangling with Pandas
- Visualization with Streamlit or Dash
- Automation with cron / AWS Lambda
- Notifications via email or messaging API
- Predictive modeling with Scikit-learn
- DevOps best practices using Docker and Git
